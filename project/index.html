        <!-- Navigation Bar -->
<!-- This is the navigation bar across all the pages and contains links to the
other pages of the website. Mainly, I have six pages in my project, which
are:
(1) “index.html”: my home page, which provides an overview of the website's
purpose and highlights key information.
(2) “products.html”: Has both apparel and gear buttons for customers to shop.
(3) “apparel.html”: Allows customers to browse through the inventory or create 
custom orders. This page is still under construction.
(4) “gear.html”: Allows customers to browse through the inventory or create 
custom orders. This page is still under construction.
(5) "aboutus.html": Gives a background story of the brand and also tells a little
about each team member. 
(6) "support.html": Provides customers with ways to create custom orders, 
cancel or return an order, and contact the customer support team. -->
