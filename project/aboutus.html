                Our Story:
                <br>
                <br>
                GiVaeKo is a brand started by Michael Thomas,
                <br>
                the grandfather aka "Paw Paw" of the group. 
                <br>
                He started this brand up because he wanted his 
                <br>
                three grandchildren to have something handed  
                <br>
                down to them when they got older. This allows 
                <br>
                for all of our family to be involved in many  
                <br>
                different ways. Check out our team to get a 
                <br>
                better understanding of how we all get involved.
